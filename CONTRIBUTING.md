## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.2.12+
- At least one supported AI engine:
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) by Anthropic
  - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) by Anomaly
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) by OpenAI
  - [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) by GitHub
  - [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) by Alibaba Qwen

Engines can be installed manually or via **Settings → System Tools** after first launch.

Clopen is a Bun-only project — Node.js and Deno are not supported. Use `bun` for all package management and scripts.

### Setup

Fork the repository via the GitHub UI, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clopen.git
cd clopen
git remote add upstream https://github.com/myrialabs/clopen.git
bun install
bun run check
```

`bun run check` should pass cleanly on a fresh clone. If it doesn't, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Keep Your Fork Updated

Before starting any new branch, sync with upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main   # optional: also sync your fork's main on GitHub
```

### Development Data Directory

When running `bun run dev`, Clopen stores data in `~/.clopen-dev` instead of `~/.clopen`. This keeps development data separate from any production instance — especially important since Clopen can be used to develop itself.

---

## Development Workflow

Standard flow from branch creation to PR:

```bash
# 1. Sync
git checkout main && git pull upstream main

# 2. Branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 3. Develop & verify locally
bun run check && bun run lint && bun run build

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"

# 5. Sync with upstream main again (resolve conflicts locally, not in the GitHub UI)
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main
bun run check && bun run lint && bun run build   # re-verify after merge

# 6. Push & open PR
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

Open the PR targeting `main` on GitHub. See [Submitting Changes](#submitting-changes) for the conventions used at each step.

---

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is needed.
- `any` is acceptable for Elysia/WS patterns where strict typing creates friction.

### Svelte 5

Use the runes system, not legacy stores. `let` for `$state` and `$bindable`; `const` for everything else (`$derived`, `$props`, functions).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let count = $state(0);
  const doubled = $derived(count * 2);
  const handleClick = () => count++;
</script>
```

### Naming

- `camelCase` — variables, functions
- `PascalCase` — classes, types
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` — constants
- `kebab-case` — file names

### Logging

Use the project's `debug` module instead of `console.*`. It respects log levels and namespaces.

```typescript
import { debug } from './utils/debug';

debug.log('namespace', 'message', { data });
```

### Formatting

Tabs, single quotes, semicolons. No Prettier enforcement — manual consistency.

### Tests

Add a `*.test.ts` file when the change introduces non-trivial logic where a regression would be silent or costly — validators, parsers, security checks, path resolution, anything with branching that isn't obvious by inspection. Place the test alongside the source: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`. Use `bun:test`.

Skip tests for changes that are inherently observable (UI tweaks, log strings, dependency bumps), trivial one-liners, or thin forwards of an already-tested function. If breaking the code would take more than a glance to notice, add a test.

For security fixes, tests are expected — at minimum a case that fails before the patch and passes after. Cover the boundary explicitly (the exact value that should be rejected) and at least one happy path.

```bash
bun test path/to/file.test.ts   # single file
bun test                        # full suite
```

Tests must pass before opening the PR.

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming

Format: `<type>/<description>` — lowercase, kebab-case, concise. **Exactly one `/`**: the type, then the description. Nested paths are not allowed.

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| `feature/` | New feature |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `docs/` | Documentation |
| `chore/` | Build, refactor, dependencies, miscellaneous |

Examples: `feature/database-management`, `fix/websocket-connection`, `docs/maintainers-guide-restructure`.

**Don't**:

| Wrong | Why | Fix |
|------|-----|-----|
| `docs/maintainers/review-examples` | Two slashes — nested path | `docs/maintainers-review-examples` |
| `Fix/Websocket-Connection` | Uppercase | `fix/websocket-connection` |
| `fix/fix-the-websocket-connection-bug-that-happens-on-reconnect` | Verbose | `fix/websocket-reconnect` |
| `feature/auth.middleware` | Non-kebab punctuation | `feature/auth-middleware` |

### Commit Messages

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` — imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 characters.

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `chore` | Refactor, build, perf, dependencies |
| `release` | Version release |

Examples:

```
feat(chat): add message export
fix(terminal): resolve memory leak
docs(maintainers): document pr reshape workflow
chore: update dependencies
```

Keep the subject focused on **why** the change exists, not what files moved. If the change needs a longer explanation, put it in the PR description, not the commit body — repo convention is subject-only.

### Pre-commit Checklist

Before pushing each commit:

- [ ] `bun run check` passes
- [ ] `bun run lint` passes
- [ ] `bun run build` works
- [ ] `bun test` passes if any test file was added or modified
- [ ] New non-trivial logic has a `*.test.ts` (see [Tests](#tests))
- [ ] Commit message follows the format above
- [ ] No `console.*` (use the `debug` module)
- [ ] No sensitive data (tokens, credentials, internal URLs)

If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying issue rather than skipping with `--no-verify`. Hooks exist for the same reasons CI does.

### Pull Request Format

#### Title

Same format as commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (lowercase, imperative, no period, ≤72 chars). GitHub uses this as the squash-commit subject on `main`.

#### Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
One or two sentences: what this PR does.

## Why
The motivation — bug it fixes, behavior it changes, constraint it addresses.

## Changes
- bullet list of concrete changes (files, modules, behaviors)

## Notes (optional)
Anything reviewers should know: trade-offs, follow-ups, areas needing extra eyes.
```

#### Optional Sections

Add only when relevant — empty headers add noise:

| Section | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `## Test plan` | Any non-trivial change. Bulleted checklist of how the change was verified (`bun run check`, manual UI test, regression test, etc.). |
| `## Security impact` | Any change touching auth, authorization, input validation, file/path handling, or external execution. State the threat model in one paragraph: who is the attacker, what they could reach before, what is closed now. |
| `## Breaking changes` | Public API, WebSocket schema, DB schema, or config keys changed. Include migration path. |
| `## Migration` | Steps existing installs need to follow (DB migration, config update, manual cleanup). |
| `## Screenshots` | UI changes — before/after images or a short clip. |
| `## Follow-ups` | Known TODOs deferred to a separate PR (with link/issue if one exists). |
| `## Related` | Links to related issues, PRs, or external discussions. |

### Comments on Existing PRs

When you add substantive context to a PR (additional commits, scope expansion, a regression caught in review), use the same `## Summary / ## Why / ## Changes / ## Notes` structure. Keep paths and identifiers in backticks. Use `@username` for mentions.

## After You Submit

A maintainer will read the full diff and audit it before responding — full process in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md). You can expect one of these responses:

| Response | What it means |
|----------|---------------|
| Approve and merge | Audit was clean. |
| Commits added to your branch | Maintainer extended your fix with adjacent changes and posted a summary. Pull before pushing anything new. |
| Comment requesting discussion | Maintainer has concerns or wants to split scope. Default response window is 1 week — silence past the deadline closes the PR as auto-stale, and you can reopen at any time. |
| Close with reshape | Approach needs to change. You'll be credited in the replacement PR — closure is administrative, not rejection. |

If you disagree with feedback, push back with a concrete scenario, file/line reference, or counterargument. The maintainer guide explicitly invites this.
