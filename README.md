## Features

A complete development environment designed around AI-assisted workflows, built to disappear into the background and just work.

- **Multi-Account Claude Code** — Manage multiple Claude Code accounts (personal, work, or team) and switch between them instantly per chat session
- **Multi-Engine Support** — Switch between Claude Code and OpenCode as your AI engine, per session
- **Integrated Terminal** — Full PTY emulation with xterm.js UI. Multi-tab terminal sessions with complete ANSI/VT sequence support and full keyboard control
- **Full Git Management** — Stage, commit, branch, push, pull, stash, log, and resolve conflicts, all from a clean UI. Powered by native git CLI for accuracy
- **Real Browser Preview** — A live browser preview streams directly into your workspace. Interact with your app manually, or let the AI drive: clicking, typing, and scrolling for autonomous visual testing
- **Git-Like Checkpoints** — Multi-branch undo/redo with full file snapshots. Roll back to any point in your AI conversation without touching your actual git history
- **Real-Time Collaboration** — WebSocket-based presence tracking per project. Multiple users can work on the same codebase simultaneously with live awareness
- **Monaco File Editor** — VS Code's editor embedded in the browser. Full syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and live file watching, right beside your AI chat
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — One-click public HTTPS URL for your local dev server. Built-in QR code for instant mobile access. Share your work without deploying
- **MCP Support** — Full Model Context Protocol integration. Connect AI tools, external APIs, and custom capabilities to your AI agents with zero friction
- **Flexible Authentication** — No Login or With Login mode with admin/member roles, invite links, rate-limited login, and CLI token recovery
- **Background Processing** — Chat, terminal, and other processes continue running even when you close the browser — come back later and pick up where you left off
- **Database Management** — Browse tables, run queries, and inspect your database directly from the workspace *(coming soon)*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun.js](https://bun.sh/) v1.2.12+
- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — required for AI functionality

### Installation

```bash
bun add -g @myrialabs/clopen
```

### Update

```bash
clopen update
```

Or manually via Bun:

```bash
bun add -g @myrialabs/clopen
```

You can also update from the **Settings > System > Updates** section in the web UI.

### Usage

```bash
clopen
```

Starts the server on `http://localhost:9141`.

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, a setup wizard guides you through:

1. **Authentication mode** — Choose between **No Login** (no authentication required, ideal for personal/local use) or **With Login** (login with Personal Access Token, supports team collaboration)
2. **Admin account** — If With Login mode is selected, create your admin account and save the generated PAT
3. **AI Engines** — Check Claude Code and OpenCode installation status
4. **Preferences** — Set theme, font size, and notification preferences

You can change the authentication mode anytime in **Settings > Security > Authentication**.

To invite team members (With Login mode), go to **Settings > Team > Invite** and generate an invite link (valid for 15 minutes).

If you lose your admin token:

```bash
clopen reset-pat
```

This regenerates and displays a new admin PAT.

## Contributing

Clopen is open source and contributions are welcome! Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or improvement to docs — feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myrialabs/clopen.git
cd clopen
bun install
bun run dev     # Start development server
bun run check   # Type checking
```

When running in development mode, Clopen uses `~/.clopen-dev` instead of `~/.clopen`, keeping dev data separate from any production instance.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines and [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for architectural decisions.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Runtime | Bun.js |
| Frontend | Svelte 5 (runes) + Vite |
| Backend | Elysia + WebSocket |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | SQLite with migrations |
| Terminal | bun-pty |
| AI Engines | Claude Code + OpenCode |

Clopen uses an engine-agnostic adapter pattern — both engines normalize output to a unified message format (`shared/types/unified`), ensuring a consistent experience regardless of which engine is selected.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port 9141 Already in Use

```bash
clopen --port 9145
```

Or kill the existing process:
```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
lsof -ti:9141 | xargs kill -9

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :9141
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
